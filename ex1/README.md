# EX 1 Google maps

Let’s implement the google map api in our code like in the slides! 

- Go to the slides and copy the code

- Create the div in the HTML (like in the slides), give it height (otherwise we will not be able to see it) and width, connect your code and test it.

- Add the marker like shown in the slides.

## EXTRA

Now let’s make it more interactive, let’s use getCurrentPosition() to find the long and lat —> https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_geolocation.asp

Pass the long and lat to the map js code to get our current position shown on the Google MAP.
